These Perl scripts can be run on a *nix system to monitor Cache and Ensemble bit.  They are mainly based on things that have bit me in the past, so feel free to add issues ore code for things that have bit you with your instance.

* MonitorCache.pl is a script for Monitoring your Cache Instance.  
  * Setup it up with a crontab to run automatically.  Usually every 5 minutes is great.
  * Run with a -d for Debugging or a more verbose output to the console.
* CachePS.pl is a quick script to see what processes are running under a namespace
